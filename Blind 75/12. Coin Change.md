# LeetCode Problem 322: [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

## Problem Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money `amount`. Write a function to compute the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We create a 2D array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount `j` using the first `i` coins. We fill in the array iteratively based on the current coin's value and the previously computed values.

## Java Solution

```java
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        if(amount )
        for(int i = 1; i<= amount; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j< coins.size();j++){
                if(i >= coins[j]){
                      dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
                }            
        }
        }
        if(dp[amount] < amount + 1){
            return dp[amount];
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * amount), where n is the number of coins and amount is the target amount. We iterate through a 2D array of size n x amount.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * amount), where n is the number of coins and amount is the target amount. We use a 2D array of size n x amount for dynamic programming.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum number of coins needed to make up each amount.
- We fill the first row with 0, as no coins are needed to make up amount 0.
- We fill the first column with the maximum value if the amount is not divisible by the first coin, and the number of coins needed to make up the amount divided by the first coin otherwise.
- We iterate through the remaining cells of the array and fill them based on the current coin's value and the previously computed values.
- The result is stored in the bottom-right cell of the array, representing the minimum number of coins needed to make up the target amount.
