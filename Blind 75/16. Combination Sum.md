# LeetCode Problem 39: [Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

## Solution Approach
- We use backtracking to generate all possible combinations of candidates that sum up to the target.
- We recursively explore all possible combinations by trying each candidate starting from the current index.

## cpp Solution Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> res;
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> cur;
        backtrack(target, res, cur, 0, nums);
        return res;
    }

    void backtrack(int target, vector<vector<int>>& res, vector<int>& cur, int start, vector<int>& nums) {
        if (target == 0) {
            res.push_back(cur);
            return;
        }
        if (target < 0) {
            return;
        }

        for(int i= start; i < nums.size(); i++){
            cur.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtrack(target - nums[i], res, cur, i, nums);
            cur.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: Exponential, as there can be many combinations generated.
- **Space Complexity**: O(target), where target is the value we are trying to reach.

## Code Explanation
1. We initialize an empty list `uniqueCombinations` to store all unique combinations.
2. We call the `combinations` method to find all combinations, starting from index 0.
3. In the `combinations` method, if the target sum becomes 0, we add the current combination to `uniqueCombinations`.
4. We iterate through the candidates starting from the `start` index and recursively call the `combinations` method with updated parameters.
5. After processing a candidate, we backtrack by removing it from the `temp` list to explore other combinations.

This approach ensures that we find all possible unique combinations that sum up to the target.
