# LeetCode Problem 91: [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

## Problem Description
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
- "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
- "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

## Solution Approach
- We use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to decode the string up to each index.
- We iterate through the string, updating the number of ways based on the current and previous characters.

## cpp Solution Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
    if (s[0] == '0') return 0;

    int one = 1; 
    int two = 1;    
    int current = 1; 

    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        current = 0;

        if (s[i] != '0') {
            current = one;
        }

        int twoDigit = (s[i - 1] - '0') * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
        if (twoDigit >= 10 && twoDigit <= 26) {
            current = current + two;
        }

        two = one;
        one = current;
    }

    return current;
}
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through the string once to calculate the number of ways.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the dynamic programming array `dp` of size N+1.

## Code Explanation
1. We initialize an array `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to decode the string up to each index.
2. We iterate through the string starting from the second character.
3. For each character, we consider the single-digit and two-digit possibilities for decoding.
4. We update the `dp` array based on the decoding possibilities.
5. Finally, we return the number of ways to decode the entire string.
