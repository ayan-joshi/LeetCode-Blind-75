# LeetCode Problem 198: [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

## Problem Description

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Solution Approach

We use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to house `i`. We iterate through the array and calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at each house based on the maximum of robbing the previous house or skipping the previous house and robbing the current house.

## cpp Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int rob1 = 0;
        int rob2 = 0;
        int maxi = 0;

        for(int i=0; i< nums.size(); i++){
            maxi = max(nums[i]+rob1, rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = maxi;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We use an array of size n for dynamic programming.

## Code Explanation

- We initialize an array `dp` to store the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to house `i`.
- We handle the base cases where if there is only one house, we return the money in that house. If there are two houses, we return the maximum amount of money between the two.
- We iterate through the array and calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at each house based on the maximum of robbing the previous house or skipping the previous house and robbing the current house.
- We return the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the last house.
