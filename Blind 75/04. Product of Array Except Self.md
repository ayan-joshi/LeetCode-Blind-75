# LeetCode Problem 238: [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)


## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of n integers where n > 1, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

## Solution Approach

We can solve this problem by creating two arrays. First, we traverse the array from left to right and compute the product of all elements to the left of each element. Then, we traverse the array from right to left and compute the product of all elements to the right of each element. Finally, we multiply the corresponding elements from both arrays to get the desired result.

## Java Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res(nums.size());
        int pre = 1;
        int post = 1;
        for(int i= 0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            res[i] = pre;
            pre = nums[i]*pre;
        }
        for(int i = nums.size() - 1; i>=0;i--){
            res[i] = post*res[i];
            post = post*nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. We traverse the array twice.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if we don't consider the space required for the output array, otherwise O(N) for the output array.

## Code Explanation

- We traverse the array from left to right and compute the product of all elements to the left of each element.
- Then, we traverse the array from right to left and compute the product of all elements to the right of each element.
- Finally, we multiply the corresponding elements from both arrays to get the desired result.
