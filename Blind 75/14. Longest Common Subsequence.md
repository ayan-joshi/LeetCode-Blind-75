# LeetCode Problem 1143:  [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. 

## Solution Approach

To find the longest common subsequence between two strings `text1` and `text2`, we can use dynamic programming. We create a 2D array `dp[][]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of substrings `text1.substring(0, i)` and `text2.substring(0, j)`. We iterate through the strings `text1` and `text2` and fill the `dp[][]` array accordingly.

## Java Solution

```cpp
  class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n = text1.size();
        int m = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(m+1));

        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--){
        for(int j = m-1; j>=0; j--){
              if(text1[i] == text2[j]){
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1];
              }
              else{
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j] , dp[i][j+1]);
              }
        }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m), where n is the length of `text1` and m is the length of `text2`. We traverse through each character of both strings once to fill the 2D array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*m), the space used by the 2D array `dp[][]` to store the length of the longest common subsequence for each substring of `text1` and `text2`.

## Code Explanation

- We create a 2D array `dp[][]` to store the length of the longest common subsequence for each prefix of `text1` and `text2`.
- We iterate through both strings and fill the `dp[][]` array based on the characters being equal or not.
- Finally, we return `dp[n][m]`, where n is the length of `text1` and m is the length of `text2`, representing the length of the longest common subsequence between the two strings.
